 better interface for alpha
 and random weight 
  looking for relationship between range of activation function vs random weight 
  
  High Level Goals::


performance load testing put a outer foor loop

noting down accuracy, ( implement way to calcuare error in  testing data ), storing general weights ( helps in determining local minima vs global minima)


I need to really get in there and tweak the digits disappearing  entirely sometimes.


bigger application 

 python multiple procceser to fork several instances ( using all those 8  logical cores )  

 perhaps in ubuntu may be ( needs to be installed )



Need to collect all the data i can from this
